# Pioneers database
Here is the the database file for [the Pioneers project](https://github.com/aluriak/se-pioneers).


## Use the database

1. find & backup the `config/user-eng-db.cfg` file in your SpaceEngine install folder
2. download the `user-eng-db.cfg` file in this repository, and place it in the `config/` folder, where was your own `config/user-eng-db.cfg` file.

Note that you can also concatenate the two files in one if you want both your annotations
and Pioneers project annotations.
